low level

-- classes and their interaction between



-- ds and alg
-- design -- more..


-- os concepts.., basic 
-- anything to be remembered, will not be focused..
-- only concepts are important..
-- start with easy problems.. gradually increase the level..
-- competitive prog not essential ..
-- competitive prog is diff domain.. speed is important..
-- python is absolutely good.
-- know about usage of algorithm.. u know whether some
algorithm can be applied to a problem.. figure out if problem
can be solved by algorithm.. utilizing algorithm.. 
understand applications of concepts..
-- start with your own company.. see how your own systems implemented.. what are diff classes ..
-- detail of low level design.
-- try to come up with your own design.
-- high level design.. how many requests..
-- if cache -- why this cache..
-- after answering design questions for your own system, then take up outside system.. twitter.. etc.. low level design, high level design..
-- ther's no correct answer// correct design..
-- write only queries.. having cache is bad idea..
-- have a discussion with person for design system..
-- multilevel parking lot.. try to observe that it is open problem.. multiple questions to be asked to the person.. regarding understanding of the problem..what features.. wide variety of questions u can ask..
-- after that, figure out design.. discuss.. not necessary to design complete system..
-- what are for higher priority and lesser..
